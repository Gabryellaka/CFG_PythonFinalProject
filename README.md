Intro to Python and Apps-Recipes Search
### What were the challenge?
-In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The standard project uses the Edamam Recipe API, but can be changed to use a different API after completing the required tasks. 
### What did we do based on what was requested?
-We've created a project that is a recipe search tool, which allows users to find recipes based on specific ingredients, dietary restrictions, and allergies. The user inputs their preferred ingredients, dietary restrictions, and allergies, and the tool generates a list of recipes that fit their criteria. The tool uses the Edamam API to search for recipes and returns the recipe information in JSON format. The user can also choose to save the recipes to a file. This project was developed in Python and is ideal for those who love to cook and want to find new recipes to try.
###
The technologies used in this project are Python and the Edamam API for recipe search. Additionally, the requests module was used to make requests to the API and the json module was used to handle the data that the API returns.
